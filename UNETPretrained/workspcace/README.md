The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for the program are as follows:

1. `UNetModel`: This class represents the UNet model and contains methods for training and evaluation.
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the UNet model with the specified parameters.
   - `train()`: Trains the UNet model using the provided training dataset.
   - `evaluate()`: Evaluates the UNet model using the provided evaluation dataset.
   - `save_model()`: Saves the trained UNet model to the specified directory.

2. `DataLoader`: This class handles loading and preprocessing of the input images and labels.
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the DataLoader with the specified parameters.
   - `load_data()`: Loads the input images and labels from the specified directory.
   - `preprocess_data()`: Preprocesses the input images and labels, including augmentation.

3. `Metrics`: This class calculates various metrics for model evaluation.
   - `__init__()`: Initializes the Metrics object.
   - `calculate_loss()`: Calculates the loss between the predicted masks and the ground truth masks.
   - `calculate_accuracy()`: Calculates the accuracy of the predicted masks.
   - `calculate_precision()`: Calculates the precision of the predicted masks.
   - `calculate_recall()`: Calculates the recall of the predicted masks.
   - `calculate_iou()`: Calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the predicted masks.

Now, let's proceed with the file structure and code implementation.

1. `entrypoint.py`:
