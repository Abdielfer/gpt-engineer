Based on the requirements and assumptions, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `UNetModel` class: This class will define the UNet model architecture and provide methods for training and evaluation.
   - `__init__()`: Initialize the UNet model with the specified parameters.
   - `train()`: Train the UNet model using the provided training dataset.
   - `evaluate()`: Evaluate the UNet model using the provided test dataset.
   - `save_model()`: Save the trained UNet model to a specified directory.

2. `DataLoader` class: This class will handle loading and preprocessing of the input and output images.
   - `__init__()`: Initialize the DataLoader with the specified dataset directory and other parameters.
   - `load_data()`: Load the input and output images from the dataset directory.
   - `preprocess_data()`: Preprocess the input and output images, including augmentation techniques.
   - `split_data()`: Split the dataset into training and validation sets.

3. `Metrics` class: This class will provide functions to calculate metrics such as Loss, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and IoU.
   - `calculate_loss()`: Calculate the loss between the predicted and target masks.
   - `calculate_accuracy()`: Calculate the accuracy of the predicted masks.
   - `calculate_precision()`: Calculate the precision of the predicted masks.
   - `calculate_recall()`: Calculate the recall of the predicted masks.
   - `calculate_iou()`: Calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) of the predicted masks.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of each file.

1. `entrypoint.py`:
