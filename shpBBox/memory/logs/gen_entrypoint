Create a Python script to read the shape file using GDAL.\n2. Extract the bounding box coordinates from the shape file.\n3. Return the bounding box coordinates as a tuple.\n\nCore classes, functions, and methods:\n1. `ShapeFileReader`: A class responsible for reading the shape file and extracting the bounding box coordinates.\n   - `__init__(self, file_path: str)`: Initializes the ShapeFileReader with the path to the shape file.\n   - `get_bounding_box(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]`: Reads the shape file and returns the bounding box coordinates.\n\nNow let's proceed with the implementation.\n\n**shape_file_reader.py**\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple\nfrom osgeo import ogr\n\nclass ShapeFileReader:\n    def __init__(self, file_path: str):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n\n    def get_bounding_box(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]:\n        driver = ogr.GetDriverByName('ESRI Shapefile')\n        data_source = driver.Open(self.file_path, 0)\n        layer = data_source.GetLayer()\n\n        extent = layer.GetExtent()\n        min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y = extent\n\n        return min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y\n```\n\n**main.py**\n```python\nfrom shape_file_reader import ShapeFileReader\n\ndef main():\n    file_path = \"path/to/shapefile.shp\"\n    reader = ShapeFileReader(file_path)\n    bounding_box = reader.get_bounding_box()\n    print(f\"Bounding Box: {bounding_box}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis implementation assumes that the GDAL library is already installed and available for use. The `ShapeFileReader` class uses the `ogr` module from the GDAL library to read the shape file and extract the bounding box coordinates. The `main` function in `main.py` demonstrates the usage of the `ShapeFileReader` class by creating an instance, calling the `get_bounding_box` method, and printing the result.\n\nPlease note that you may need to install the GDAL library and its Python bindings using a package manager or by following the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
