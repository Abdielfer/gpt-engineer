Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Create a Python script to read the shape file using GDAL.
2. Extract the bounding box coordinates from the shape file.
3. Return the bounding box coordinates as a tuple.

Core classes, functions, and methods:
1. `ShapeFileReader`: A class responsible for reading the shape file and extracting the bounding box coordinates.
   - `__init__(self, file_path: str)`: Initializes the ShapeFileReader with the path to the shape file.
   - `get_bounding_box(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]`: Reads the shape file and returns the bounding box coordinates.

Now let's proceed with the implementation.
