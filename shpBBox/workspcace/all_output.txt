Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the step-by-step plan:

1. Create a Python script to read the shape file using GDAL.
2. Extract the bounding box coordinates from the shape file.
3. Return the bounding box coordinates as a tuple.

Core classes, functions, and methods:
1. `ShapeFileReader`: A class responsible for reading the shape file and extracting the bounding box coordinates.
   - `__init__(self, file_path: str)`: Initializes the ShapeFileReader with the path to the shape file.
   - `get_bounding_box(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]`: Reads the shape file and returns the bounding box coordinates.

Now let's proceed with the implementation.

**shape_file_reader.py**
```python
from typing import Tuple
from osgeo import ogr

class ShapeFileReader:
    def __init__(self, file_path: str):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def get_bounding_box(self) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]:
        driver = ogr.GetDriverByName('ESRI Shapefile')
        data_source = driver.Open(self.file_path, 0)
        layer = data_source.GetLayer()

        extent = layer.GetExtent()
        min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y = extent

        return min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y
```

**main.py**
```python
from shape_file_reader import ShapeFileReader

def main():
    file_path = "path/to/shapefile.shp"
    reader = ShapeFileReader(file_path)
    bounding_box = reader.get_bounding_box()
    print(f"Bounding Box: {bounding_box}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This implementation assumes that the GDAL library is already installed and available for use. The `ShapeFileReader` class uses the `ogr` module from the GDAL library to read the shape file and extract the bounding box coordinates. The `main` function in `main.py` demonstrates the usage of the `ShapeFileReader` class by creating an instance, calling the `get_bounding_box` method, and printing the result.

Please note that you may need to install the GDAL library and its Python bindings using a package manager or by following the installation instructions specific to your operating system. Additionally, you may need to handle any additional dependencies or package management requirements based on your specific environment.
