The `reproject_crop.py` file contains the main function `reproject_crop_tif` which orchestrates the reprojection and cropping process. The `gdal_utils.py` file contains utility functions `reproject_tif` and `crop_tif` that handle the GDAL operations.\n\nThe `reproject_tif` function in `gdal_utils.py` reprojects the input TIFF file to the specified CRS using GDAL's `gdal.Warp` function. It takes the input TIFF file path and the output CRS as arguments and returns the path to the reprojected TIFF file.\n\nThe `crop_tif` function in `gdal_utils.py` crops the input TIFF file using the provided shapefile as a mask. It takes the input TIFF file path, shapefile path, and output file path as arguments and returns the path to the cropped TIFF file.\n\nThe `reproject_crop_tif` function in `reproject_crop.py` is the entrypoint function that calls the `reproject_tif` and `crop_tif` functions in `gdal_utils.py` to perform the reprojection and cropping. It takes the input TIFF file path, shapefile path, and output file path as arguments and returns the path to the cropped TIFF file.\n\nPlease note that the code assumes that the necessary GDAL and OGR libraries are installed and accessible in the Python environment. Additionally, appropriate error handling and validation can be added to the code as per specific requirements.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "example": false}}]
