Based on the requirements, here is the proposed architecture:

1. `reproject_crop.py`: This is the entrypoint file that contains the main function to reproject and crop the TIFF file using a shapefile as a mask.

2. `gdal_utils.py`: This module contains utility functions to handle the GDAL operations, such as reprojection and cropping.
