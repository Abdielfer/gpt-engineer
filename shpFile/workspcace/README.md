Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the proposed architecture for the Python program:

1. `shapefile_reader.py`: This module will contain the main logic to read the shape file and extract the bounding box.

   - `get_shapefile_bounding_box(shapefile_path: str) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]`: This function takes the path to the shape file as input and returns the bounding box coordinates as a tuple of four floats: (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y).

2. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the program.

Now, let's proceed with implementing the code for each file.

`shapefile_reader.py`
