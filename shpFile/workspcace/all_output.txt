Based on the requirements and assumptions, here is the proposed architecture for the Python program:

1. `shapefile_reader.py`: This module will contain the main logic to read the shape file and extract the bounding box.

   - `get_shapefile_bounding_box(shapefile_path: str) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]`: This function takes the path to the shape file as input and returns the bounding box coordinates as a tuple of four floats: (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y).

2. `main.py`: This will be the entry point of the program.

Now, let's proceed with implementing the code for each file.

`shapefile_reader.py`
```python
import os
from typing import Tuple
from osgeo import ogr

def get_shapefile_bounding_box(shapefile_path: str) -> Tuple[float, float, float, float]:
    if not os.path.exists(shapefile_path):
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"Shape file not found at path: {shapefile_path}")

    driver = ogr.GetDriverByName("ESRI Shapefile")
    shapefile = driver.Open(shapefile_path, 0)
    if shapefile is None:
        raise ValueError(f"Failed to open shape file at path: {shapefile_path}")

    layer = shapefile.GetLayer()
    extent = layer.GetExtent()

    shapefile.Destroy()

    return extent
```

`main.py`
```python
from shapefile_reader import get_shapefile_bounding_box

def main():
    shapefile_path = input("Enter the path to the shape file: ")
    try:
        bounding_box = get_shapefile_bounding_box(shapefile_path)
        print(f"Bounding Box: {bounding_box}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This completes the implementation of the Python program to read shape files with GDAL and return the shape file's bounding box.
