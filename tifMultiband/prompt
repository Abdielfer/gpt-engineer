Create a python code with to read several single layer tif files from a list of patt and return a unique multilayer file of geotif format. The list of path will be provided from a csv file. Each line in the csv will contain only one path. If duplicated path are provided in the CSV, consider only one. The code must be able to read different kind of tif files, like uint8 or int16, etc. The output must be geotif, data type flot32. Create also a notebook with a simple code to read the multy band tif file and show the image in RGB. Use the extention and CRS of the first input file to set the output raster crs and metadata. Do not need to handle any spetial case. If a path inm CSV point to a corrupted tif files, pas to the next CSV line if exist and print "The tif in the path {line in the CSV} is corrupted". Save the multiband geotiff in the same directory of the first valid input, with the prefix "multyLayer"
