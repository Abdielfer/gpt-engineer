The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for this task are:

1. `CSVReader`: A class responsible for reading the CSV file and extracting the unique paths.
   - `read_csv(file_path: str) -> List[str]`: Reads the CSV file and returns a list of unique paths.

2. `TIFFReader`: A class responsible for reading the TIFF files and extracting the necessary information.
   - `read_tiff(file_path: str) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, str, str]`: Reads the TIFF file and returns the image data, file extension, and CRS.

3. `MultiLayerTiffWriter`: A class responsible for creating the multilayer geotiff file.
   - `write_multilayer_tiff(file_path: str, data: List[np.ndarray], file_extension: str, crs: str) -> None`: Writes the multilayer geotiff file with the given data, file extension, and CRS.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files.
